# Prediction of Indian climate changes using linear regression

This project aims to visualize the data from different timelines and understand the importance of climate conditions. various methods and techniques to analyze the historical and current trends of temperature and other factors that affect the climate. The project also uses machine learning models (linear regression) to predict future climatic conditions based on the data. The project aims to answer the following questions:

- How has the climate of India changed over the years?
- What are the main factors that influence the climate in India?
- How can we use linear regression to model the relationship between climate variables and time?
- How accurate are our predictions, and what are the limitations of our model?

## Install 
This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Data Source 
The data used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data), which contains the global land temperature by country, state, and major cities.

## Explanation

- Data cleaning: We remove any missing or invalid values from the data and check for any outliers or anomalies.
- Data visualization: We use various plots and charts to explore the data and understand the trends and patterns of the climate variables over time and across different cities.
- Data transformation: We apply some transformations to the data, such as scaling, normalization, and encoding, to make it suitable for linear regression.
- Model building: We use linear regression to build a model that can predict the future values of the climate variables based on time. We use the scikit-learn library in Python to implement the linear regression algorithm.
- Model evaluation: We evaluate the performance of our model using various metrics, such as mean absolute error and coefficient of determination.
